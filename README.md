# AskMyLogs 🔍

> **⚠️ Project Status: Ideation & Early Development**
>
> AskMyLogs is currently in the ideation and planning phase. The platform is not yet built, and all features described below are part of our vision for the future. We are actively exploring technologies, gathering feedback, and defining the minimum viable product (MVP). If you are interested in shaping the direction of AskMyLogs, your input is welcome!

## 🌟 Project Vision: AskMyLogs

AskMyLogs is an ambitious project in its ideation phase, aiming to revolutionize how organizations interact with their observability data. The core idea is to create a unified, AI-powered platform that bridges the gap between complex observability tools and the natural language queries of engineers, SREs, and DevOps teams.

### Why AskMyLogs?

Modern cloud-native systems generate massive amounts of logs, metrics, and traces. However, extracting actionable insights from this data is often challenging due to:
- Fragmented tools and dashboards
- Steep learning curves for query languages
- Siloed knowledge across teams
- Slow incident response and root cause analysis

AskMyLogs envisions a world where anyone can simply “ask” about their system’s health, performance, or incidents—no matter which tools or data sources are in use.

### What Makes AskMyLogs Unique?

- **Natural Language Interface:** Users interact with the platform using plain English (or other languages in the future), lowering the barrier for troubleshooting and analysis.
- **Unified Data Model:** Aggregates and normalizes data from various observability tools (Grafana, DataDog, Splunk, Elastic, etc.) into a single, queryable platform.
- **AI-Powered Insights:** Leverages large language models and custom ML to correlate events, detect anomalies, and suggest remediations.
- **Plugin Architecture:** Easily extensible to support new tools and data sources as the observability landscape evolves.
- **Self-Hosted & Secure:** Designed for enterprise needs, ensuring data privacy and compliance.

### Ideation Goals

During this phase, the focus is on:
- **Validating the Problem:** Engaging with potential users to understand their pain points with current observability workflows.
- **Defining the MVP:** Outlining the minimum set of features that deliver value, such as basic natural language querying and integration with a few popular tools.
- **Exploring Technologies:** Researching the best approaches for data ingestion, normalization, and natural language processing.
- **Community Feedback:** Gathering input from engineers, SREs, and DevOps professionals to shape the product roadmap.

### How You Can Help

- **Share Your Observability Challenges:** What’s hardest about your current setup?
- **Suggest Features:** What would make observability effortless for you?
- **Join the Discussion:** Help us prioritize integrations, features, and use cases.

## Example Use-cases

### Incident Response
```
Engineer: "Why is checkout failing?"

AskMyLogs: "I found 3 issues in the last 15 minutes:
1. Payment service showing 503 errors (85% failure rate)
2. Database connection pool exhausted
3. High memory usage on payment-service-3

Root Cause: Database connection leak in payment validation
Recommendation: Restart payment-service-3 and check connection pooling configuration"
```

### Performance Analysis
```
Engineer: "API response times are slow today"

AskMyLogs: "API latency increased by 300% since 2 PM:
- Database query time: +150ms average
- Cache hit rate dropped from 95% to 60%
- Redis memory usage at 90%

Suggested Actions:
1. Clear Redis cache
2. Optimize database queries in user-service
3. Scale Redis cluster"
```

### Capacity Planning
```
Engineer: "Will our infrastructure handle Black Friday traffic?"

AskMyLogs: "Based on current trends and last year's data:
- Expected 10x traffic increase
- Database CPU will hit 80% (recommend scaling)
- CDN bandwidth sufficient
- Payment service needs 3 additional instances

Recommended prep: Scale database and payment service by Nov 20"
